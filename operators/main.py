Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

# Arithmetic operators
a = 10
b = 20
# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a % b)
# print(a // b)
# print(a ** b)

# x = 33
# y = 3
# print(x / y)

# Assignment operators

# a = 10

# # a = a + 10
# a += 10
# a -= 10
# a *= 10
# a /= 10
# a %= 10
# a **= 10
# a //= 10
# print(a)
