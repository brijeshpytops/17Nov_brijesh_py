"""
Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, class names, etc.) because they are part of the Python language itself. Attempting to use a keyword as an identifier in your code will result in a syntax error.


Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.
